### What it is:


A rails app which helps aspiring Developers to land their dreamjob by giving them the opportunity to practise for job interviews. You can do so by conducting mock interviews with other users, who have the same experience level and want to practise the same language as you.  You can either join an interview of another user or create one yourself.
